this is a work that makes use of the ARM assembler language so that 
it is called in a main file in c where the functions are called in .s 
to use a 7 X 4 display with which to have two different counters of 
two digits (tens and units) so that when pressing a button it indicates 
which is the direction in which the counters should go, that is if
it counts one by one or two by two, the first counter is ascending and 
takes the even numbers; the second is descending and takes the odd ones.
